Hi! My name is Tianrui Song. A first-year M.Res. AIML (AI and Machine Learning) student in Computing Department at Imperial College London, supervised by [Professor Oana-Maria Camburu](https://sites.google.com/view/oana-maria-camburu/).
Previously, I obtained my M.Phil. degree at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou) under the supervision of [Prof. Hao Liu](https://raymondhliu.github.io) and [Prof. Jingshen Wu](https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/people/wu-jingshen/).

My recent research focuses on Large Language Models and Recommender Systems. Now I am working on LLM Alignement as my MRes project. Besides that, as a Vlogger, I am also interested in adapting LLMs for effective and efficient content creation (videos, films, movie scripts, novels, etc.).
I hope my research can be applied to tangible, commercially viable projects that address the practical needs of people in real life.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
